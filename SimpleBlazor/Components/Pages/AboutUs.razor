<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>1. Build a shelter:
Objective: We would partner with the town council, obtain grants from various organizations, and build a dedicated facility to house feral cats - providing them with food, medical care, and a safe environment.
Implementation: 
Secure funding from grants, donations, and partnerships with local organizations.
Identify a suitable location for the shelter and purchase land, preferably near areas with already high feral cat populations.
Hire a contractor to build the shelter and set up necessary infrastructure such as feeding areas, medical facilities, and secure enclosures.
Preferably staff with volunteers or paid staff to manage daily operations, possibly hire a part time veterinarian.
Establish programs and protocols for trapping and transporting feral cats
Benefits:
Creates a humane solution by offering feral cats a safe environment.
Reduces the risk of disease transmission and reduces nuisances in the community.
Challenges:
High initial and recurring costs for construction, staffing, and maintenance.
A single animal shelter is unlikely to have capacity to house all feral cats in the area.

2. Mobile Neuter Clinic:
Objective: Reduce the feral cat population by partnering with veterinarians in the area and offering low-cost or free spaying and neutering services through a mobile clinic.
 Implementation:
Reach out to local vets and find out which would be willing to help us in our mission.
Schedule “Vet Days” in towns around Ephraim - Manti, Mt. Pleasant, etc - when the mobile vet clinic would visit.
Advertize the event through the news papers, community events, and social media.
Set up training for volunteers to safely trap, transport, and release feral cats after surgery.
Benefits:
A relatively cost effective solution compared to building a permanent shelter.
Directly addresses overpopulation by preventing future litters.
Challenges
Would require annual funding and coordination.
Some in the community might object to spaying/neutering cats if they are unfamiliar with the benefits.
3. Information Campaign:
Objective: Educate the community about the feral cat problem, humane solutions, and steps they can take to get involved.
Implement Steps
Develop educational materials, such as flyers, social media posts, and radio ads.
Host meetings to inform the community about the issue and ways to get involved. These could be at the college, libraries, or even churches.
Partner with KSL, the SnowDrift, and other local media to spread awareness.
Benefits:
Increases public knowledge and support for humane animal management solutions.
An information campaign would likely foster an attitude of community responsibility and involvement.
One of the lowest cost solutions, especially compared to building a shelter or developing a mobile vet clinic.
Challenges:
Getting people to take action.
Effectively distributing information to a diverse community population. Likely requiring effective technical communication in both Spanish and English.
It could take some time to see tangible results in reducing the feral cat population.
4. Do Nothing:
Objective:
Allow the feral cat population in Ephraim, UT to regulate itself naturally without human intervention.
Potential Outcomes:
Cats will continue to reproduce, leading to larger populations and continual new litters of feral cats.
Ongoing issues with nuisance behaviors.
Continual increase in the spread of diseases, such as feline leukemia or rabies to other cats and possibly humans.
Benefits:
Requires no additional funding or grants from the town.
Prevents possible conflicts with the community over implementing new rules and programs.
Challenges:
Seen as neglectful by many residents currently living in Ephraim and could discourage people from potentially moving here.</p>
